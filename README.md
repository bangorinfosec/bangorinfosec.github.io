Network Excavation: Pivoting, Forwarding, and Tunneling Around ACLs 

Join Cory Cavanagh as he discusses bypassing network and firewall access control lists (ACLs) using tunnelling and port forwarding techniques. DNS, ICMP, HTTP/HTTPS, and SSH tunneling will be covered as well as common scenarios where these techniques can be utilized. We will then leverage these tunnelling and port forwarding techniques on a fictional penetration test exercise to pivot into restricted network segments using Metasploit's meterpreter.
